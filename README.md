# Studytime
### What is it
Studytime will keep you on track while studying. By looking at the URL of each tab, we are able to close distracting tabs and keep the user on task. They are able to add their own websites or even keywords to keep them on track. They are also able to select the severity of how often they have to be reminded to get back to work. You can start the app by  saying "start a study session".

### Inspiration
College students face a ridiculous amount of distractions and we want to get rid of them so students can first focus on their work.

### What we used
Studytime was built as a Python Flask app. In addition, we also utilized Google Dialogue Flow.
